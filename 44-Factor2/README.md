## Factor#2

#### Difficulty: `Low`

- - -

### Description

> Write the program to calculate what is the number of factor of N for q queries (q questions).
>
> For example:
>
> N = 20
>
> The factor of N are 1,2,4,5,10,20 so the number of factor of N is 6.

### Input

>There are two lines of input.
>
>The first line represents q (the number of query). (1<=q<=1,000)
>
>The second line contains q positive integers x[i] (the integer that you have to find the number of factor).
>
>(2<=x[i]<=1,000,000)

### Output

>The only one line of output contains q integers for each number represents the number of factor of the i-th query.
