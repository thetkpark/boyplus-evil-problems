Because of that, you have to be his assistance due to him losing all his data on the laptop. The first thing you have to do is write the program the compute the grade for your classmate. This is a very easy one which P'Pop could magically finish it in just 5 seconds. But, the point of having a slave oh, sorry an assistant is that he wants to be doing something else. So, the task must be yours. In this semester there is only 4 range of grading. A, B, C, and D.
