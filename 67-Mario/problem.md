Each block contains coins equal to its position in the line of block ( i.e., Block number 1 have 1 coins, block number 238 have 238 coins ). In addition, some blocks have more coins according to the following conditions: 

1. every 3 block, the number of coins is 2x. 

2. every 5 block, the number of coins is 3x. 

3. every 15 block the number of coins is 10x.
