### Sample I/O

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 5     | 2      |
| 8     | 1      |
| 13    | 3      |



### Hint

>For the first sample, we can add one bacterium in the box in the first day morning and at the third morning there will be 4 bacteria in the box. Now we put one more resulting 5 in the box. We added 2 bacteria in the process so the answer is 2.

>For the second sample, we can put one in the first morning and in the 4-th morning there will be 8 in the box. So the answer is 1.
