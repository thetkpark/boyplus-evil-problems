#### Difficulty: `Mid`
- - -
### Description
> You are given an array size of N. Write the program to calculate the summation of element in array since index a to index b for q quries. (The index of array start with 0).

### Input
>There are q+3 lines of input.
The first line presents N (the size of array) (1<=N<=100,000)
The second line contains N integers represented by A[i]. (1<=A[i]<=1,000).
The third line represents q (the number of query) (1<=q<=100,000).
The next q line follow. The i-th line contains two positive integer a and b (0<=a<=b<N).

### Output
>There are q lines of output for each line represents the summation of element in array since index a to index b.
