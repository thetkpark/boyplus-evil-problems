## Partial Sum #1
#### Difficulty: `Low`
- - -
### Description
> You are given an array size of N. Write the program to calculate the summation of element in array from index a to b (inclusive) for q queries. (The index of array start with 0).

### Input
>There are q+3 lines of input.
The first line represents N (the size of array) (1<=N<=1,000)
The second line contains N integers the i-th integer represents to A[i] (the integer in array). (1<=A[i]<=1,000).
The third line represents q (the number of query). (1<=q<=1,000).
The next q lines follow. The i-th line contains two positive integers a and b (0<=a<=b<N).

### Output
>There are q lines of output for each line represents the summation of element in array from index a to b (inclusive).
