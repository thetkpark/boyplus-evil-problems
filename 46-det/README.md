#### Difficulty: `Mid`

- - -

### Description

> God boy want to test your smartness about determinant but determinant of 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 matrix is too easy to test your smartness, so he gives you a N x N matrix your task is to calculate the determinant of this matrix.

### Input

>The first line represent one positive integer N (1<=N<=8).
>
>The next N lines. The i-th (1<=i<=N) line contains N integer A[i][j] (1<=j<=N).
>
>(1<=A[i][j]<=10)

### Output

>The only one line represent the determinant of the matrix.
