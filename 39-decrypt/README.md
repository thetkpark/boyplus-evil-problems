##  Decrypt Code 

#### Difficulty: `Mid`

- - -

### Description

> You are given one string of code that contains characters and integers which unordered.
>
> You need to decrypt this code by if you get character then return in integer which is Alphabet Sequence ( a=1,b=2,c=3,...,z=26) (case-insensitive).
>
> But if you get integer, you will return a real value of this integer. Then, return sum of unique prime factor from this summation.
>
> Ex: 90ab4c output is 7
>
> 90 + 1 (a) + 2 (b) + 4 + 3 (c) = 100
>
> The prime factors of 100 are 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
>
> Answer is 2+5 = 7

### Input

>The only one line of input represent the code which contains integer and characters.
>
>Length of code does not greater than 100.

### Output

> The only one line of output is Sum of Unique prime factor from summation of code.
